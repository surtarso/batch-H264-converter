Batch H.264 Converter
===========================

Point it a folder of video files (supports any source media that FFMPEG does).

It will scan through a directory and convert any video files to the following:
- .MP4 container (although .mkv is arguably a better continer - .mp4 is the most widely compattible)
- H.264 video codec (the most widely supported video codec on modern media players / smart tv's / etc.)
- AAC audio (as with H.264, widely supported and good quality)

Designed to work with existing libraries in media servers such as Plex Media Server.
The covnerter will automatically skip anything that's already in the desired format, or that it doesn't understand.
Supports PushBullet notifications.


---------INSTALLATION

1. Install the pre-requisites
apt-get install php5 php5-curl mediainfo ffmpeg

2. Slurp it down with GIT
git clone https://github.com/surtarso/batch-H264-converter.git


--------USAGE (all files in one folder)

Before using - open config.php and customise to your liking.
Note that at a minimum you'll need to customise the scratch and junkyard folders for this tool to work (it comes set up for my environment, which probably won't work for you.

After customising your configuration, sinply point it at a directory, then be very, very patient...
./batch-h264-converter /folder/of/videos/

--------USAGE (deeply nested files /show|movie/title/season/etc)

Befora using - open media_convert.sh and customise the locations
Note that you will still need to customise config.php and locations must match (will fix later)

After setting config.php and media_convert.sh, simply run the script, then be very, very patient...
./media_convert.sh


I personally recommend running this converter using screen - so you can close your terminal window and come back to it later...
screen -R conveter
./batch-h264-converter /folder/of/videos/
or
./media_convert.sh
